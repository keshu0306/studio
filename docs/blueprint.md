## Original User Request:
i want to make a project on usb access control system (os based) for my college semester. 
i want a roadmap to create the project for windows os .
it should be gui based not web based with database (mysql). 
it should have a proper functional frontend with real time monitoring of (data transfer and format USB data ) process in percentage. and other essential parts like pause transfer , block the ports if any malware is detected (so that data does not get transfered) and ask for authentication to access any features or to unblock ports.
also add notification alerts like data has been transfered , block / unblock ports, new device is connected.
